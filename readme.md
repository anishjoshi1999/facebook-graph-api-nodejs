# Facebook Page Automation with Node.js

This project demonstrates how to automate Facebook page posts using Node.js and the Facebook Graph API. Automating Facebook posts through code unlocks several possibilities, such as managing your page with bots or analyzing engagement metrics.

In the future, more advanced features will be added. Upcoming blog posts will cover topics such as posting images, videos, and scheduling posts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can post to your Facebook page via Node.js, you will need:

1.  **Facebook Page ID** -- The unique identifier for your Facebook page.
2.  **Facebook Page Access Token** -- A token that allows you to interact with your Facebook page through the Graph API.

For more details on obtaining these items, refer to my blog: [How to Get Your Facebook Page ID and Access Token for API Integration](https://medium.com/@anishjoshi1999/how-to-get-your-facebook-page-id-and-access-token-for-api-integration-2e35ce7f0206).



### Note

Since the Facebook API is in developer mode, your posts will only be visible to the page admin. In future updates, I will include instructions on how to make the posts public once the API is out of developer mode.

## What's Next?

Here are some features that will be added in future updates and covered in new blog posts:

- Posting images, videos, and stories.
- Scheduling posts.
- Replying automatically to comments.
- Tracking engagement metrics such as post reach.

Stay tuned for more advanced projects and features using the Facebook Graph API!
